    <h2>
        Privacy Policy
    </h2>

    <p>
        Your privacy is very important to us. Accordingly, we have developed this Policy in order for you to understand how we collect, use, communicate and disclose and make use of personal information. The following outlines our privacy policy.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Before or at the time of collecting personal information, we will identify the purposes for which information is being collected.
        </li>
        <li>
            For website logins, the Microsoft Account API grants us access to user ID, name, email address and your personal contacts. We store your user ID, name and email address, but do not look at or store any of your personal contacts. The only reason we have access to your contacts is because the MS API lumps personal contacts in with your email address.
        </li>
        <li>
            For every account that signs onto the UCDialplans.com website, we gather and store the following information about you (note, this does not apply to API users):

            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            For every ruleset generated, we gather and store the following information about you:
            <ul>
                <li>your Microsoft UserID, which is a 16-character GUID. If you are using the API, we store the API key</li>
                <li>the IP address where the connection originated</li>
                <li>the user agent string of the connecting device</li>
                <li>all selected options for the selected ruleset, including extension information, if applicable</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            We will collect and use of personal information solely with the objective of fulfilling those purposes specified by us and for other compatible purposes, unless we obtain the consent of the individual concerned or as required by law.
        </li>
        <li>
            We will only retain personal information as long as necessary for the fulfillment of those purposes.
        </li>
        <li>
            We will collect personal information by lawful and fair means and, where appropriate, with the knowledge or consent of the individual concerned.
        </li>
        <li>
            Personal data should be relevant to the purposes for which it is to be used, and, to the extent necessary for those purposes, should be accurate, complete, and up-to-date.
        </li>
        <li>
            We will protect personal information by reasonable security safeguards against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification.
        </li>
        <li>
            We will make readily available to customers information about our policies and practices relating to the management of personal information.
        </li>
        <li>
            We will ensure that all customer data is handled in accordance with all applicable data privacy laws, including GDPR.
        </li>
        <li>
            We will provide a full, portable copy of all data that we gather in CSV format upon request by email to our privacy officer, who can be reached at klasko@ucdialplans.com
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        We are committed to conducting our business in accordance with these principles in order to ensure that the confidentiality of personal information is protected and maintained.
