<P>Entering a rule suffix can help you distinguish between extension blocks for different sites.  </P>
<P>For example: If you are entering an extension range for your head office in London, UK, you could enter a suffix like <strong>"HeadOffice"</strong>.  The generated rules would look like <strong>UK-London-20-HeadOffice</strong>.</P>
<P>Rule suffixes can contain letters, numbers, dashes or underscore characters.  No spaces are allowed.</P>
<P>This is optional. If not entered, the Optimizer will use a suffix of "Internal" for the rule names.</P>
