<P>If each extension maps to its own dedicated external phone number (Direct Inward Dialing (DID) or Direct Dial-In (DDI)), select the <strong>DID</strong> checkbox and enter the common phone number prefix and extension range.</P>
<P>For example: if your users have DID/DDI numbers between 15195552000 to 15195552999 and you want to be able to dial internally as 2000-2999, then select the <strong>DID</strong> checkbox, enter <strong>1519555</strong> in <strong>Main Number Prefix</strong> and <strong>2000</strong> and <strong>2999</strong> in <strong>Extension Start</strong> and <strong>Extension End</strong> respectively. The <strong>Example</strong> box will show how Lync will normalize the phone number. In this example, the normalized number range will be from +15195552000 to +15195552999.  When a user dials 2111, it will normalize to +15195552111.</P>
<P>If you are connecting to an upstream PBX, Lync will send only the extension to the PBX.  If you are connecting to a SIP trunk, the full e.164 phone number will be sent.</P>
