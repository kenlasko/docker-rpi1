# --- EXCEPTIONS: Keep the specific 'local' menu folder ---
# To keep a subdirectory, you must un-ignore it AND all its parent
# directories that were caught by the initial ignore rule.
# The '!' negates a previous ignore rule for the specified path.
# Un-ignore the path down to the desired directory:
!netbootxyz/config/
!netbootxyz/config/menus/
!netbootxyz/config/menus/local/
# --- IMPORTANT: Prevent tracking other files/folders within the un-ignored parents ---
# Since we un-ignored `config/` and `menus/` just to traverse them,
# we now need to explicitly ignore their direct contents (*),
# while still allowing traversal into the next required subdirectory.
netbootxyz/config/*
!netbootxyz/config/menus/
netbootxyz/config/menus/*
!netbootxyz/config/menus/local/
# --- FURTHER EXCLUSION: Ignore a specific file within the kept folder ---
# Now that netbootxyz/config/menus/local/ and its contents are tracked (except as specified above),
# specifically ignore the omni.ipxe file inside it.
netbootxyz/config/menus/local/omni.ipxe
