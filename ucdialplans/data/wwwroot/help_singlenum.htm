<P>Sometimes a user's extension does not match at all with the assigned DID.  Selecting this option will allow you to map a single extension to an unrelated DID.</P>
<P>For example: A user has a DID of +14165551111.  Their internal extension is x285.  Selecting the Single and DID options allow you to ensure that when someone types in 285 in Lync, it will normalize to their full DID and route accordingly.</P>
